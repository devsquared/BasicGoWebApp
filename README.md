# basic-go-web-app
This is a template repository for a basic go web application. This template
does not use any frameworks and sticks to the bare necessities from the standard library 
as much as possible. 

I have found this pattern to be very effective for POCs or early stage designing of an app. 

Some resources I have found useful in building this and many other go web apps:
- Jon Calhoun's courses: https://courses.calhoun.io (highly recommended)
- Mat Ryer's blogs and videos: https://grafana.com/blog/2024/02/09/how-i-write-http-services-in-go-after-13-years/
